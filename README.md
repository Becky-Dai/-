# Flower Knowledge Graph Visualization

This flower knowledge graph visualization is developed based on neo4j graph database and Django framework for python. I first use python's crawler to crawl the web page data in a structured way, then use py2neo's library and neo4j database to query the data, and finally use echarts.js to visualize the data in the front-end of the web page.
