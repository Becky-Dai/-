# Flower Knowledge Graph Visualization

This flower knowledge graph visualization is developed based on neo4j graph database and Django framework for python. I first use python's crawler to crawl the web page data in a structured way, then use py2neo's library and neo4j database to query the data, and finally use echarts.js to visualize the data in the front-end of the web page.

# Part 1: crawl the data
Step 1：set up neo4j username and password in link_neo4j.py.
Step 2: Run crawler.py to crawl the URL "http://www.aihuhua.com/hua/". The crawled data will be in the data folder, which I zipped and uploaded.
# Part 2：create the knowledge graph

# Part 3：visualize the data
